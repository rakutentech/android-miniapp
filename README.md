# MiniApps SDK for Android

Provides a set of tools and capabilities to show miniapps in Android Applications. The SDK offers features like fetching, caching and displaying of miniapps. 
For instructions on implementing in an android application, the User Guide will be made available soon.

## How to build

```bash
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
