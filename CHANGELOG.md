## CHANGELOG

### 2.0.0 (in progress)
**SDK**
- **Upgraded:** `minSdkVersion` has been bumped up to 23 (Android 6.0).
- **Removed:** `MiniAppDisplay#getMiniAppView()`, `MiniApp#create(info: MiniAppInfo)` has been removed.
- **Removed:** `MiniApp#create(info: MiniAppInfo, miniAppMessageBridge: MiniAppMessageBridge)` has been removed.

### 1.2.0 (2020-07-21)
**SDK**
- Upgraded build setup and some internal dependencies
- Added support for customization of user agent information. See [this](https://github.com/rakutentech/android-miniapp/blob/master/miniapp/USERGUIDE.md#2-configure-sdk-settings-in-androidmanifestxml)
- Added feature to support backward & forward navigation support in a mini app
- Added support for javascript of type module e.g. `<script src="some_module.js" type="module"></script>` would render just fine now even though the mimetype is missed out by the web technologies for this scenario.
- Added feature to obtain geolocation data in a mini app
- Hotfix for redirection over custom scheme and http

**Sample App**
- Updated styling of the mini app list
- Updated App's setting screen with build information
- Demo usage of customized user agent information
- Add navigation into mini app

### 1.1.1 (2020-06-11)

**SDK**
- *Bugfix:* `select` and `date` input elements weren't working correctly.
- Deprecated `MiniAppDisplay#getMiniAppView()` and added `MiniAppDisplay#getMiniAppView(activityContext: Context)`. You now must provide an Activity Context when retrieving the `View` for the Mini App. This is related to the bugfix for `select` and `date` inputs - if you use the deprecated method, then these elements will not work correctly.

**Sample App**
- Display first time setup instructions on first launch of App.

### 1.1.0 (2020-06-02)

- Added JavaScript bridge for passing data between Mini App and Host App. Your App now must implement `MiniAppMessageBridge` and provide the implementation when calling `MiniApp#create`.
- Deprecated `MiniApp#create(info: MiniAppInfo)`. Your App should instead use `MiniApp#create(info: MiniAppInfo, miniAppMessageBridge: MiniAppMessageBridge)`.
- Added `getUniqueId` function to `MiniAppMessageBridge`. This function should provide a unique identifier (unique to the user and device) to Mini Apps.
- Added support for custom scheme URL redirect. The URL `mscheme.MINI_APP_ID://miniapp/index.html` can be used by a Mini App for redirection. This matches the URL used in the iOS Mini App SDK.

### 1.0.0 (2020-04-21)

- Initial release
